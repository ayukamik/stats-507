      "\n",
      "Aug. 14, 2001 \n",
      "Dow Jones Energy Service \n",
      "Copyright c 2001, Dow Jones  Company, Inc. \n",
      "\n",
      "This article was originally published Monday NEW YORK Dow Jones New England consumer advocates Monday said federal energy regulators overstepped their jurisdiction in ordering the consolidation of the wholesale electricity markets and transmission systems in the northeast U.S. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Federal Energy Commission in midJuly directed operators of the power grids in New York, New England and the MidAtlantic to merge, as part of a sweeping series of orders designed to put control of the countrys transmission system in independent hands. \n",
      "\n",
      "Federal law allows the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to require transmission systems to connect, but only at the request of a state regulators, according to a filing made by Maine law firm on behalf of consumer groups, nonprofit energy groups and the attorney general of Massachusetts. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Commission makes no claim in the New England Order that it is acting at the behest of a state commission or public utility, and is, therefore, without authority to mandate the involuntary combination of the Northeastern RTOs, the groups said in their filing, which asked FERC to reconsider its consolidation decision. \n",
      "\n",
      "FERC should give the three Northeast grid operators a transition period to evolve into three regional transmission organization, or RTOs, with similar market designs, transmission tariffs and governance structures before requiring them to merge, the filing said. \n",
      "\n",
      "The commission directed the operators of the wholesale power grid in New England, New York and the MidAtlantic to meet with utilities, generators, trade groups, state regulators and a FERC judge in Washington for 45 days beginning July 19 to outline plans for creating one transmission organization from Washington, D.C., to Maine. The regulators also directed Judge Peter Young to submit recommendation to them 10 days after the conclusion of the talks. \n",
      "\n",
      "The commission ordered the consolidation of the Northeast power grid at breakneck speed without studying the technical feasibility of creating one RTO and without analyzing the costs and benefits of merging, the consumer groups said in their filing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Young has directed meeting participants not to discuss the substance of the negotiations, but sources familiar with the talks said the group is outlining a business model describing how to structure a Northeast RTO without filling in the details. Participants have said, for example, that this regional market should have one transmission tariff and one interconnection standard, but havent defined what that tariff and standard should be. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many people are very discouraged by the ongoing talks, said Anthony Buxton, an attorney with the Maine law firm that submitted Mondays filing. \n",
      "\n",
      "All 300 meeting participants have been gathering in Washington twice a week and have been working on the issues every day outside of those meetings, Young said. Next week, they will break off into smaller groups and begin meeting every day, according to Young and market participants. \n",
      "\n",
      "The commission was in turmoil when it issued its RTO decision, as evidenced by Chairman Curt Heberts resignation last week, and should therefore reconsider its order, Buxton said. \n",
      "\n",
      "The consumer groups also asked the commission to allow residential electricity users to have a say in how the unified electricity market in the northeast U.S. will run. Market participants, including consumers, will have an advisory capacity only in this new market and wont be allowed to vote on the rules that govern the market, as they do now, Buxton said. \n",
      "\n",
      "This decision contradicted another one FERC issued in 1996 requiring utilities to open their transmission lines to competitors. In that order, the commission encouraged New England to create an independent system operator to oversee the power grid and to give market participants equal say in determining how this regional transmission system and electricity market would operate \n",
      "\n",
      "The consumer groups that filed Monday are working to galvanize other organizations representing residential customers in New England, Buxton said. \n",
      "\n",
      "Consumers are going to be at the forefront of a massive attack on FERC for what its done, Buxton said. \n",

      "LOS ANGELES Dow JonesFederal energy regulators may investigate whether the operator of Californias wholesale electricity market has been manipulating its powerpurchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state purchased under longterm contracts, according to documents obtained Friday by Dow Jones Newswires Friday. \n",
      "\n",
      "At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state under contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The states need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has proven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed 43 billion in deals to head off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California Monday to address generators complaints. The energy companies say that the California ISOs purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement. \n",
      "\n",
      "The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resources  which has been buying power in lieu of the states struggling utilities since midJanuary  and several generators, all of which were to attend the meeting. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedures of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine months, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market structure, Wolfman said in her letter. The purpose of the meeting is to develop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch generators, utilities, CDWR on appropriate practices and procedures. \n",
      "\n",
      "ISO Procedures Need Explaining FERC \n",
      "\n",
      "The ISOs main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the states electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines which power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the ISO cant explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an audit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated the market, Wolfmans office said. \n",
      "\n",
      "As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational audit of CAISO, a second letter from FERCs market oversight and enforcement division states. This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and other practices by the ISO should be investigated. \n",
      "\n",
      "The ISOs operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest power first. \n",
      "\n",
      "The information that generators have provided all leads to a theory that the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR power at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment, the second letter says. \n",
      "\n",
      "The ISO has said only that the market isnt operating as intended, and declined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Mondays meeting. \n",

Thats because, according to the allegations, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as outofmarket purchases that arent averaged into the realtime prices that ISO market participants see. \n",
      "\n",
      "DWR continues to buy outofmarket power regularly at the ISOs request, DWR operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWRs longterm contracts. \n",
      "\n",
      "The outofmarket purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to the ISOs August market report, the average outofmarket price for peak hours was 55.90 a megawatthour, compared with 26.49MWh on the ISO computerized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than the outofmarket prices for months. \n",

      "LOS ANGELES Dow JonesThe California Assembly is to consider a bill Friday to place a progressive tax on electricity sales in California , the second windfall profits tax measure to be heard by legislators in a week. \n",
      "\n",
      "Under Assembly Bill 2XX, introduced by Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett, DSan Leandro, generators wouldnt be taxed on power priced below 60 per megawatthour. Prices above 60MWh would be subject to a gradually increasing tax. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first 30 charged by suppliers over the 60MWh baseline would be taxed at a 50 rate. The next 30 would be taxed at 70. Anything higher would be taxed at 90. \n",
      "\n",
      "The tax would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2001 and effective through 2005. Tax proceeds would be used to fund a state sales tax holiday on the first weekend in December. Alternative energy suppliers, or qualifying facilities, as well as selfgenerators, would be exempt from the tax. \n",
      "\n",
      "Any excess receipts after the sales tax holiday would be used to provide tax credits to companies for building new generation. \n",
      "\n",
      "AB 2XX will help Californians recoup and regain financial footing in an economy that is changing very quickly, said Corbett. This measure is a major step for California s recovery from this years disastrous energy crisis. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the bill passes the Assembly floor, it will move to the Senate for committee and floor votes. The legislature is set to adjourn Sept. 14. \n",
      " \n",
      "       Similar Bill On Assembly Floor Monday \n",
      "   \n",
      "A second windfall profits tax bill is likely to be heard on the Assembly floor Monday, said a spokesman for the bills sponsor, Sen. Nell Soto, DOntario. The bill passed out of the Assembly Appropriations Committee Thursday. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bill, SB 2XX, would require state regulators to establish a costbased price for electricity for each plant in the state. Sellers would be taxed 100 on any sales from a plant that exceeded its costbased price, and the money would be used for taxpayer rebates. The costbased price would include up to a 20 return on invested capital. \n",
      "\n",
      "The tax, which would be effective retroactively to Jan. 1, 2001, would apply to the last sale before electricity hits the power grid, and so would include marketers as well as generators. Cogeneration facilities and renewable generators would be exempt, as would some state municipal utilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bill has a good chance of passing the Assembly floor, since only a majority vote is required and Democrats dominate the Assembly 5030, said Soto spokesman Paul Van Dyke. Thus far, the bill has passed the Senate and various committees in the Assembly on strict party lines. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the bill does pass the Assembly floor, it would go back to the Senate for concurrence, and then to the governors desk to be signed. Van Dyke said he did not know which windfall profits tax bill was more likely to pass out of both houses before the legislature adjourns, nor whether the two might be cobbled together to form one bill. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our bill is two steps from going to the governor the other bill has a ways to go, Van Dyke said. Sometimes two bills on the same issue will pass and go all the way to the governor, and its up to him to choose. \n",
      "\n",
      "A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis said last week that he was open to a windfall profits tax bill, but would not indicate which bill he might prefer.\n",

      "\n",
      "The New York ISO asked FERC to approve an extension through April 30, 2002, for the price cap, which first went into effect in July of last year. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, FERC said it expected power supplies in New York City and Long Island to remain tight through the summer of 2002. The ISO would likely request another bid cap extension at that time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, FERC said the price cap will last as an interim measure until the new Northeast Regional Transmission Organization is up and running. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe that our decision ... will promote price certainty and market participants confidence in the New York ISOadministered markets, which will increase supply, improve reliability and ... lower energy prices, the agency said in its order. \n",

      "The New York ISO operates one of the nations biggest wholesale electric markets with billions of dollars in transactions. \n",
      "\n",
      "The 1,000 price cap was first adopted to control market manipulation and prevent artificially inflated prices. The cap is supported by several large utilities, such as Consolidated Edison Inc. , which were concerned about high wholesale power prices that occurred after the New York ISO took control of the states power grid. \n",
      "\n",
      "FERC aims to create four huge Regional Transmission Organizations to replace the New York ISO and similar groups in managing the nations power grid. Federal regulators see the RTOs as a way to avoid a repeat of the power crisis in California last winter, in which the antiquated U.S. grid prevented more power from flowing into the state. \n",
      "\n",
      "Under FERCs plan, the RTOs would be forprofit groups in the U.S. Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and West. Each region would combine public utility transmission facilities to provide open access, more reliable power and lower rates for consumers. \n",
      "\n",

      "Thats the outlook for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions plan to create four new large regional power transmission groups to manage the nations electric grid. The efficient, stable, economical PJM Interconnection grid system thats taken over 70 years to refine would be twisted and subverted to serve the needs of highcost New York. \n",

      "LOS ANGELES Dow Jones The California agency buying power in lieu of the states ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of 45 a megawatthour, the agency said Wednesday. \n",
      "\n",
      "The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as 1 a megawatthour because it secured too much electricity under longterm contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov. Gray Davis, the department said. \n",
      "\n",
      "In a press release, the departments California Energy Resources Scheduling division, its powermarketing arm, said it resold 224,871 megawatthours, or 1.1 of its total purchases. That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts, not the longterm contracts, the department said. \n",
      "\n",
      "Such sales are typical of any powerbuying operation, as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways, the department said. \n",
      "\n",
      "The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the states three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own longterm contracts  or about onethird of the total. \n",
      "\n",
      "According to the DWR, power secured under Davis longterm contracts covers onethird to onehalf of the electricity it must supply. Shortterm deals, such as monthly or quarterly contracts, represent onethird of the portfolio. The rest is bought in the spot market. \n",
      "\n",
      "The state has put its average cost of power under the longterm contracts at 7.9 cents per kilowatthour for the first five years and 6.9 cents per kilowatthour for the next five years. \n",
      "\n",
      "Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices. Similarly, the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices. \n",
      "\n",
      "The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position, the department said. \n",
      "\n",
      "The DWR buys power for customers of PGE Corp. PCG unit Pacific Gas  Electric, Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas  Electric.\n",

      "Per Section 25.345 c of the Electric rules, if the Cogen facility has a rated capacity of 10MW or less, it qualifies as eligible generation under Section 25.345cB. In Section 25.345i, an enduser whose actual load is lawfully served by eligible generation and who does not receive any electrical service that requires the delivery of power through the facilities of a T  D utility is not responsible for payment of any stranded cost charges.  \n",
      "\n",

      "The short answers to your questions are\n",
      "1. Rock Tenn will not be required to pay CTC charges if its rated output is less than 10MW, and it does not take any TD services from TXU.\n",
      "2. If Rock Tenn uses TD facilities occasionally, it will pay CTC only for the actual services it receives from the T D utility. \n",
      "3. If Rock Tenn completely disconnects from the utilities TD services, it will be in the same position as in 1 above. It will not be required to pay the CTC.\n",
      "4. At this time, TXU does not have a financing bond issued by the Commission. In an earlier order, the Commission approved 363 MM for TXU, but that order was appealed, and the Supreme Court remanded the case to the Commission for rehearing. With information that is available to it at this time, the Commission does not think that TXU has stranded costs. I believe TXU will disagree. It will be interesting to see how this plays out.\n",

      "Per the information you provided Trish below concerning CTC in TX, the cogen design is less than 10MW. Therefore, what are the DG rules and how do these rules impact Rock Tenns requirement to pay CTC? What if they only use the utilitys TD facilities occasionally when the cogen is not running? What if they completely disconnect from the utilitys TD facilities, as if they are no longer in business? Is TXU expected to have significant stranded costs?\n",

      "Per Chapter 39.252b1 of the Texas Utilities Code, recovery of stranded costs by an electric utility shall be from all existing or future retail customers within the utilitys certificated territory as it existed on May 1, 1999. A retail customer may not avoid CTCs by switching to a new onsite generation. New onsite generation is defined as an electric generator generating more than 10 MW, capable of being lawfully delivered to the site without use of the utility T  D facilities, and which was not fully operational prior to 123199.

      "Eric Cope worked as a summer associate in the Research Group during the summer of 2001.  During this time, Eric worked on a variety of projects requiring a diverse set of skills.  In all cases, he quickly grasped the scope and context of the problems at hand.  While some direction was given in each case, Eric was often charged with developing the approach details independently, and he executed the tasks very effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "One major project for the summer was to develop a webbrowserbased trading simulation platform TSP.  The TSP would create user accounts, require user logons, post simulated market information, post simulated commidity prices, accept and execute buy and sell transactions for users, and track user account information such as positions, order history, and buying power.  The TSP would allow for the use of human users as well as software agent.  Simulated commidity prices could be histroical prices, ficticious calculated prices, or bidoffer prices based on some update algorithms.  The primary goal was to create a framework to test different udpate algorithms and trading strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eric immediately arranged for the appropriate reference materials to develop the database and associated software infrastructure.  In short order, a simple site was up for users to create accounts and begin trading commodities.  The project ended before extensive algorithm evaluation could begin, however, the TSP goes a long way to making such evaluations possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other projects included the development of forecast models for motion picture box office revenues, advertising media placement prices, and longdistance voice telephony prices.  In many of the cases, data were scarce, as were definitive instructions.  Eric analyzed the problem to develop a focused approach, always in consultation and discussion with others, but never with handholding or intense oversight.  His coworkers and immediate supervisor quickly developed confidence in Erics ability to take general direction and achieve productive results.  Such confidence and ability is crucial in an environment with limited structure, such as we had.\n",

      "Enron Tries to Dismiss Finance Doubts\n",
      "By FLOYD NORRIS\n",
      "\n",
      "Enron newsquote has ample access to cash, the companys chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional writeoffs stemming from unusual financing activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after Enrons stock plunged on Monday, the chief executive, Kenneth W. Lay, strongly defended the companys chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into. \n",
      "\n",
      "But he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer. In addition, Mr. Fastow, while declaring that Enron expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations, declined to answer any questions about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conference call, which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange, at first seemed to be reassuring investors. Within minutes of the beginning of the call, the share price rallied to 23.25. But it soon began falling, and ended the day down 86 cents, at 19.79. The days low of 19.62 was the lowest since Jan. 12, 1998, and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000.\n",
      "Until recently, most investors focused on the companys reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving offbalance sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a 1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the companys strongest supporters has been David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. But he told Mr. Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information. There is an appearance that you are hiding something, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the call, Mr. Fleischer expressed disappointment. Theyve engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about, and that are hard to understand, he said in an interview. They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them as is needed, he said. But he said he was still recommending the stock. I dont think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans, he said. In the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company, there is tremendous value here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr. Fastow. But he emphasized that both he and the companys board continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enrons reporting in conjunction with another offbalancesheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns onethird of Azurix newsquote, an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors have determined there is no writedown required, he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Grubman said that Marlin owed almost 1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake. Noting that Enron had paid about 300 million to buy a third of Azurix from public shareholders and had since taken writedowns on its investment in Azurix, Mr. Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt, which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details. Eventually he cut off Mr. Grubman. I know youre trying to drive the stock price down, and youve done a pretty good job of it, Mr. Lay said. But lets move on to the next question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had 1.85 billion in such debt outstanding. He said it was backed by 3.35 billion in bank lines of credit, of which 1.75 billion will expire next May if it is not renewed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lay said he was sorry about the misunderstanding that resulted when his brief mention of the 1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts. That reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report, but it did not. He said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future, but made no promises.\n",
      "\n",
      "The large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings, and so was not in the earnings release. But it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement. The S.E.C. is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "After one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin, Mr. Lay said the company will look into providing such statements.\n",

      "\n",
      "Stack Manager Changes\n",
      "\n",
      "Top of Stack limit orders  This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the traders stack price. Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a  Top of Stack Entry it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to turn on this functionality select the  Allowed Top of Stack option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the Allowed  option should be selected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Restricted Top of Stack limit orders  This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the traders stack price. Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a  Top of Stack Entry it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to turn on this functionality select the  allowed as Restricted Top of Stack option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the Allowed  option should be selected. If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the Restricted Top of Stack feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab   Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager. In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title. A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear. Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter. To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the  All option from the drop down box.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Website Changes\n",
      "\n",
      "New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders   The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order.  In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box. \n",
      "\n",
      "Price of Limit Orders \n",
      "\n",
      "Modify Limit Orders\n",
      " Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order. In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the Todays Orders section. The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product. Once the price is at the desired level click the Set button and the price will be modified. Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order.  You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expiration time for Limit Orders\n",
      "Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days. Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Float the Todays Orders Section\n",
      "You can now float the  Limit Order  section. In order to do so, right click in the Todays Orders  section and select the float window option. In order to make the window  Stay On Top  right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mid Market Client  Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.\n",
      "\n",
      "Changes to Website Passwords  As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted. First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID. Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days. These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001. The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week.  Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords.\n",

      "persistent view of many that suppliers are holding back\n",
      "generation in order to jack up prices. Similar charges\n",
      "were levied during the oil crises of the 1970s. In those\n",
      "days, critics complained that tankers could be seen just\n",

      "supply fundamentals at the heart of the current energy\n",
      "crises were inherited from an earlier era of regulatory\n",
      "stumbles.\n",
      "Officials in neighboring states are eager to blame\n",
      "California for the crisis, but nothing could be further from\n",
      "the truth. The Western power market is fully\n",
      "interconnected by design and if one part is short, all\n",
      "regions are short. In fact, every operating area\n",
      "recognized that demand would occasionally exceed\n",
      "supply planners simply relied on the proposition that it\n",
      "would not happen simultaneously in all regions of the\n",
      "West. However, this is exactly what has happened.\n",
      "The current crisis was precipitated by a scarcity of\n",

      "the hydroelectric system very well and planned to add\n",
      "thermal generation facilities to ensure adequate supply\n",
      "even under criticalwater conditions. These conditions\n",
